It's your first day on the job at Maple Enterprises Incorporated as an associate box scanner, and boy howdy are you excited to get to some scanning. As you walk into the warehouse, seven-hundred seventy-seven (you're really good at counting) boxes stacked on top of each other loom, going up to the ceiling. You sigh. There's no way you're getting those down - good thing the company-provided Scan-O-Matic can operate at long distances.

You reach in to your pocket and whip out: nothing. Oh no! You forgot your Scan-O-Matic at home! And Maple Enterprises uses a proprietary matrix code system: no chance the barcode scanner on your phone has support for it! Luckily, you're a bit of a nerd, and had snagged a spec sheet from the front office just earlier this day. With nothing but your smartphone, the spec sheet, and some competitive programming practice from back in high school, can you whip up your own implementation and save your day?
