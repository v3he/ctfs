Your red team has gained the creds of a user and is trying to use it against a Linux workstation with SSH open. Unfortunately it seems this user is not granted shell access through SSH onto this system. Maybe there is a way to figure out what the user is doing on the system without needing to get a shell?

Note, this flag does not use static MD5 hash inside the flag{ and } wrapper.
