Oh no! A ransomware operator encrypted an environment, and exfiltrated data that they will soon use for blackmail and extortion if they don't receive payment! They stole our data!

Luckily, we found what looks like a configuration file, that seems to have credentials to the actor's storage server... but it doesn't seem to work. Can you get onto their server and delete all the data they stole!?
