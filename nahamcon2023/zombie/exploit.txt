1. connect with ssh to the machine
2. read .user-entrypoint.sh
3. someone readed the flag with the tail command, but the flag.txt is not there anymore
4. go the /proc folder
5. go on by one of the PID like this: ls -l /proc/<PID>/fd/
6. Replace <PID> with the actual process ID. In the output, you should see a number of links. One of them should point to /home/user/flag.txt (deleted). This is the file descriptor tail is using to read the file. Even though the file has been deleted, tail still has a handle to it, and the contents are still available until tail closes the file descriptor.
